A fun and easy way to play scattegories on your phone!

1) Here is a good tutorial/documentation for Git: https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial

2) To use Git, you can download it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads, 
or you can use a Gui like SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
It's probably better to learn from the command line, but SourceTree will help you visualize how Git works and is probably easier to use.

3) To be able to start sharing code in Git, you'll need to clone the repo. There should be a link in GitHub to clone it.

4) Once you have it cloned, you can pull master.
   Here is a possibility for our branching structure:
master: Contains our tested/working code.
dev: Contains our current development work. (dev will be a branch off of master)
